                "Understanding and recognizing emotions in individuals with ASD is vital for their " \
                "well-being and inclusive communities. ASD individuals struggle with perceiving and interpreting " \
                "emotions, leading to social isolation. Improved emotional recognition enhances social skills" \
                " and connections. Recognizing emotional needs benefits caregivers, educators, and professionals. " \
                "Society benefits from understanding ASD emotions, promoting empathy. Emphasizing emotional " \

part2_content = "1. Everyday Interactions and Emotions Tool: Autistic individuals often struggle to recognize and understand emotions in themselves and others, " \
                "especially when upset. Here are some helpful approaches:\n1.	Emotion Pointing: Clearly identify and " \
                "name emotions, starting with basic ones like happiness, fear, and anger, and gradually progress to " \
                "more complex emotions like jealousy or frustration. For example, say: I can see you're frustrated. " \
                "Are you having trouble with that guitar chord?\n" \
                "2.	Sensation Description: Encourage individuals to describe the physical sensations that accompany " \
                "their emotions. If someone seems worried, suggest they describe it as a 'blender in their stomach' " \
                "or acknowledge a faster heartbeat when feeling scared.\n" \
                "3.	Emotional Recognition in Media: Watch movies or shows together, like 'Inside Out',' " \
                "and discuss how characters' behaviours reflect their emotions. This helps individuals learn to " \
                "recognize emotions in others by connecting them to specific expressions or actions.\n" \
                "4.	Visual Tools: Use visual aids like ladder pictures or thermometers to help individuals gauge and" \
                " communicate their emotional intensity. Create a ladder with different rungs labelled with numbers " \
                "or pictures representing anger levels. For example, a smiley face for minimal anger and an enraged " \
                "face or exploding head emoji for extreme anger.\nBy using these strategies, we can support individuals " \
                "with ASD in understanding and recognizing their emotions, improving communication and emotional " \
                "well-being."

part3_content = "1. Calming down steps: (You can help autistic children and teenagers calm down from strong" \
                " emotions using a 5-step process)\na. Notice the emotion.\nb. Name the emotion.\nc. Pause and say " \
                "nothing.\nd. Support your child while they calm down.\ne. Address the issue that sparked the emotion.\n" \
                "2. Relaxation exercises: Individuals could try some relaxation exercises to see what works for them." \
                " For example, they could count to 10, take 5 deep breaths, or think about something that makes them" \
                "happy and calm. They could also try using their fingers to focus on their breathing. " \
                "Using a finger, your child slowly traces around their hand, breathing in when they trace up to the " \
                "top of a finger and breathing out when they trace back down a finger. Repeat for all 10 fingers." \
                "\n3. Sensory stimulation: Individual could clap their hands if they’re excited or squeeze a cushion " \
                "or a sensory toy if they’re angry. Fidget toys from a sensory kit or stimming might also help." \
                "If the individual's sensory-seeking behaviour isn’t appropriate, you might be able to replace it " \
                "with a different behaviour that meets the same sensory need. For example, if your child rocks, " \
                "they could use a rocking chair instead. If they pick their skin, they could fiddle with rings or " \
                "a bracelet or pick off clear nail polish instead. \n4. Break time: Individuals could go for a walk," \
                " get a drink of water, or find a quiet place to sit.\n5. Change of activity: Encourage the individual " \
                "to take a brain break and listen to their favourite music, read a book or listen to a podcast about" \
                " their special interests.\n6. Physical activity: Individual could go for a short run, kick a " \
                "football, do some push-ups or shoot some basketball hoops."
